1. Environment Setup
Installed Node.js (which includes npm) to manage the React project dependencies.
Verified the installation with:
node -v
npm -v

3. Create React App
Initialized the project using:
npx create-react-app breeze-real-estate
Resolved script execution errors by setting PowerShell's execution policy for the current user:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

5. Built the Application Structure
Created reusable React components:
Header.js: For navigation and branding.
HeroSection.js: Highlighted the companyâ€™s tagline with a visually appealing hero image.
PropertyCards.js: Showcased real estate properties in a card layout.
Footer.js: Added company contact details and social links.
Imported these components into App.js to structure the page.

6. Enhanced Styling
Used Tailwind CSS to add modern, responsive, and clean designs:
Installed Tailwind:
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
Configured Tailwind in src/index.css.
Styled each component using Tailwind's utility classes.

7. Tested the App
Started the app locally to check functionality:
npm start
Opened the app in the browser at http://localhost:3000 and ensured everything displayed correctly.

8. Optimized for Deployment
Built the app for production:
npm run build

9. Deployed the App
Deployed using Vercel:
Installed the Vercel CLI:
npm install -g vercel
Logged into Vercel and deployed the app with:
vercel
Verified the live app with the provided deployment URL.
Alternatively, prepared the build/ folder for manual deployment via Netlify if needed.

10. Debugging and Problem-Solving
Resolved issues such as:
Missing start script by regenerating package.json or reinstalling dependencies with:
npm install
Execution policy errors in PowerShell.
Outcome
Successfully created and deployed a responsive, visually appealing, single-page React app showcasing the Breeze Real Estate Agency design.
The app now serves as a dynamic and interactive showcase of real estate properties, ready for user interaction and further enhancement.
